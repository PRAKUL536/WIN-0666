  <strong>Important Security Information:</strong> Browsers do not allow direct execution of downloaded files for security reasons. After the download completes, you will need to manually locate the file in your downloads folder and run it. Be extremely cautious when downloading and running executable files from the internet, as they can potentially harm your computer. Only download files from trusted sources.
